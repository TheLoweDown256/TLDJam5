		<Text>DEUTZIA: These trees are engineered to convert sunlight to energy useable by most Nomaian technology. In total, the Photovoltaic Trees installed on <![CDATA[<color=orange>The Astrophytum</color>]]> are currently producing 50 NEU (Nomaian Energy Units).</Text>

		<Text>DEUTZIA: A strange thing I've noticed is that the trees actualy produce the greatest amount of energy at 20% of their maximum size. If the Photovoltaic Trees were to grow to their full size, they would only be able to generate around 20 NEU total.</Text>

		<Text>DEUTZIA: For this reason, it is important that we limit the Photovoltaic Trees to only 20% of their full growth potential.</Text>
