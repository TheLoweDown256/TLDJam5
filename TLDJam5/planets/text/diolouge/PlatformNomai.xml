			<Page>We came here from the [NAME] system to share the knowledge we found there. Unfortunatley, our vessel, [SP NAME], suffered damage upon our arival.</Page>
			<Page>The black hole in our warp core malfunctioned in some way, and now [SP NAME] is rapidly miniaturizing into it!</Page>
			<Page>Worse still, we couldn't even recover any of our exploration logs as all the computers refused to show anything other than "EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY"</Page>
			<Page>If [SP NAME] isn't fixed, we won't be able to recover our exploration logs. And, if those logs aren't recovered, all the knowledge we gained will be lost.</Page>

			<Page>We appreciate your offer, but I'm worried there's just no chance for us to save our exploration logs.</Page>
			<Page>We would need to figure out what's wrong with [SP NAME], find a solution, and fix [SP NAME] all before it is sucked into the black hole.</Page>
			<Page>We only had just over 20 minutes to evacuate so, unfortunately, I don't see any way to get all that done in what little time we have...</Page>
			<Page>If you want to try anyways, you can use this shuttle behind me to warp directly to [SP NAME], though it may be wise to bring your own ship just in case. Just make sure to evacuate if you can't fix [SP NAME] before it's completely gone.</Page>
